There was a young lady called Kate,
    Whose maths was right up-to-date.
       She said, "It is fun
       When three 3's are one --
    Which they are with modulo 8."

If inside a circle a line
    Hits the center and goes from spine to spine
       And the line's length is "d",
       The circumference will be
    d times 3.14159.

'Tis a favorite project of mine
    A new value of pi to assign.
       I would fix it at 3
       For it's simpler, you see,
    Than 3 point 1 4 1 5 9.
